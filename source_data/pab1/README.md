We downloaded Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx and Supplementary_Table_5.xlsx directly from the supplemental information of the published manuscript.
Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx contains single mutant scores. 
It has two sheets, one with the linear scores and one with log-transformed scores.
We manually converted both sheets to separate csv files.
Supplementary_Table_2.xlsx contains the double mutant scores.
We manually converted the scores inside of the "All_Epistasis" sheet to a csv file.
